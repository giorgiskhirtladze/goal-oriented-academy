    <p>Diauehi (Georgian დიაოხი, Urartian Diauehi, Greek Taochoi, Armenian Tayk, possibly Assyrian Daiaeni) was a tribal union located in northeastern Anatolia, that was recorded in Assyrian and Urartian sources during the Iron Age.[12] It is usually (though not always) identified with the earlier Daiaeni (Dayaeni),[13] attested in the Yonjalu inscription of the Assyrian king Tiglath-Pileser I's third year (1118 BC) and in later records by Shalmaneser III (845 BC). While it is unknown what language(s) they spoke,[14]: 205  they may have been speakers of a Kartvelian,[15][16][17][18][12][19][20][21][22] Armenian,[23][24][25] or Hurrian language.[26][27][28][29][30]</p>
