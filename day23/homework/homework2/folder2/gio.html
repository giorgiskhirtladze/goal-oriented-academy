        <h1>Ancient Greece</h1>
        <p>Ancient Greece (Greek: Ἑλλάς, romanized: Hellás) was a northeastern Mediterranean civilization, existing from the Greek Dark<br> Ages of the 12th–9th centuries BC to the end of classical antiquity (c. 600 AD), that comprised a loose collection of culturally and <br>linguistically related city-states and other territories. Most of these regions were officially unified only once, for 13 years, under <br>Alexander the Great's empire from 336 to 323 BC.[a] In Western history, the era of classical antiquity was immediately followed by the <br>Early Middle Ages and the Byzantine period.[1]

            Three centuries after the Late Bronze Age collapse of Mycenaean Greece, Greek urban poleis began to form in the 8th century<br> BC, ushering in the Archaic period and the colonization of the Mediterranean Basin. This was followed by the age of Classical Greece,<br> from the Greco-Persian Wars to the 5th to 4th centuries BC, and which included the Golden Age of Athens. The conquests of Alexander the<br> Great spread Hellenistic civilization from the western Mediterranean to Central Asia. The Hellenistic period ended with the conquest of<br> the eastern Mediterranean world by the Roman Republic, and the annexation of the Roman province of Macedonia in Roman Greece, and later<br> the province of Achaea during the Roman Empire.
            
            Classical Greek culture, especially philosophy, had a powerful influence on ancient Rome, which carried a version of it throughout<br> the Mediterranean and much of Europe. For this reason, Classical Greece is generally considered the cradle of Western civilization, the<br> seminal culture from which the modern West derives many of its founding archetypes and ideas in politics, philosophy, science, and art.<br></p>
