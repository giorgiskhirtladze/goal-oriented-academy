    <p>Since Charlemagne, the realm was merely referred to as the Roman Empire.[38] The term sacrum ("holy", in the sense of "consecrated") in connection with the medieval Roman Empire was used beginning in 1157 under Frederick I Barbarossa ("Holy Empire"): the term was added to reflect Frederick's ambition to dominate Italy and the Papacy.[39] The form "Holy Roman Empire" is attested from 1254 onward.[40]

        The exact term "Holy Roman Empire" was not used until the 13th century, before which the empire was referred to variously as universum regnum ("the whole kingdom", as opposed to the regional kingdoms), imperium christianum ("Christian empire"), or Romanum imperium ("Roman empire"),[32] but the Emperor's legitimacy always rested on the concept of translatio imperii,[g] that he held supreme power inherited from the ancient emperors of Rome.[30]</p>
