    <p>The Roman Empire[a] was the post-Republican state of ancient Rome and is generally understood to mean the period<br> and territory ruled by the Romans following Octavian's assumption of sole rule under the Principate in 31 BC.<br> It included territory in Europe, North Africa, and Western Asia, and was ruled by emperors.<br> The fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476 conventionally marks the end of classical antiquity and the beginning of the Middle Ages.<br>

        Rome had expanded its rule to most of the Mediterranean and beyond, but became severely destabilized<br>in civil wars and political conflicts which culminated in the victory of Octavian over Mark<br> Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC and the subsequent conquest of the Ptolemaic Kingdom in Egypt.<br> In 27 BC the Roman Senate granted Octavian overarching power (imperium) and the new title of Augustus, marking his accession<br> as the first Roman emperor of a monarchy with Rome as its sole capital. The vast Roman territories were organized in <br>senatorial and imperial provinces.
        
        The first two centuries of the Empire saw a period of unprecedented stability and prosperity known as the Pax Romana <br>(lit. 'Roman Peace'). Rome reached its greatest territorial expanse under Trajan (AD 98–117); a period of increasing<br> trouble and decline began under Commodus (180–192). In the 3rd century, the Empire underwent a crisis<br> that threatened its existence, as the Gallic and Palmyrene Empires broke away from the Roman state,<br> and a series of short-lived emperors led the Empire. It was reunified under Aurelian (r. 270–275).<br> Diocletian set up two different imperial courts in the Greek East and Latin West in 286;<br> Christians rose to power in the 4th century following the Edict of Milan. The imperial seat moved from Rome to Byzantium in 330,<br> renamed Constantinople after Constantine the Great. The Migration Period, involving large invasions by Germanic<br> peoples and by the Huns of Attila, led to the decline of the Western Roman Empire.<br> With the fall of Ravenna to the Germanic Herulians and the deposition of Romulus Augustus in 476 by Odoacer, the Western Roman Empire<br> finally collapsed. The Eastern Roman Empire survived for another millennium with Constantinople as its sole capital, until the city's<br> fall in 1453.[f]</p>
