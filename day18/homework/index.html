    <h1>History of Cristmas</h1>

    <p>Christmas is an annual festival commemorating the birth of Jesus Christ, observed primarily on December 25[a] as a religious<br> and cultural celebration among billions of people around the world.[2][3][4] A feast central to the Christian liturgical year,<br>it follows the season of Advent (which begins four Sundays before) or the Nativity Fast, and initiates the season of Christmastide,<br> which historically in the West lasts twelve days and culminates on Twelfth Night.[5] Christmas Day is a public holiday in many<br> countries,[6][7][8] is celebrated religiously by a majority of Christians,[9] as well as culturally by many non-Christians,[1][10],<br> and forms an integral part of the holiday season organized around it.

    The traditional Christmas narrative recounted in the New Testament, known as the Nativity of Jesus, says that Jesus<br> was born in Bethlehem, in accordance with messianic prophecies.[11] When Joseph and Mary arrived in the city, the inn had no room<br> and so they were offered a stable where the Christ Child was soon born, with angels proclaiming this news to shepherds who then spread<br> the word.[12]
    
    There are different hypotheses regarding the date of Jesus' birth and in the early fourth century, the church fixed the date<br> as December 25.[b][13][14][15] This corresponds to the traditional date of the winter solstice on the Roman calendar.<br>[16] It is exactly nine months after Annunciation on March 25, also the date of the spring equinox.[17] Most Christians celebrate<br> on December 25 in the Gregorian calendar, which has been adopted almost universally in the civil calendars used in countries<br> throughout the world. However, part of the Eastern Christian Churches celebrate Christmas on December 25 of the older Julian calendar,<br> which currently corresponds to January 7 in the Gregorian calendar.<br> For Christians, believing that God came into the world in the form of man to atone for the sins of humanity, rather than knowing<br> Jesus' exact birth date, is considered to be the primary purpose in celebrating Christmas.[18][19][20]
    
    The celebratory customs associated in various countries with Christmas have a mix of pre-Christian, Christian, and secular themes<br> and origins.[21][22] Popular modern customs of the holiday include gift giving; completing an Advent calendar or Advent wreath;<br> Christmas music and caroling; viewing a Nativity play; an exchange of Christmas cards; church services; a special meal; and the display of various Christmas decorations, including Christmas trees, Christmas lights, nativity scenes, garlands, wreaths, mistletoe, and holly.<br> In addition, several closely related and often interchangeable figures, known as Santa Claus, Father Christmas, Saint Nicholas, and the<br> Christkind, are associated with bringing gifts to children during the Christmas season and have their own body of traditions and lore.<br>[23] Because gift-giving and many other aspects of the Christmas festival involve heightened economic activity,<br> the holiday has become a significant event and a key sales period for retailers and businesses.<br> Over the past few centuries, Christmas has had a steadily growing economic effect in many regions of the world.</p>
